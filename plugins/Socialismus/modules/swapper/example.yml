# SWAPPER DOCUMENTATION
#
# - whereareiam:
# Preface, it was described earlier that you can use this to create shortcuts for
# messages or emojis. But all functionality is not limited to that, you can create
# much more, it only depends on your imagination.
#
# If you have any suggestions for improvements to this module, please feel free to
# post a suggestion on the github page. https://github.com/whereareiam/Socialismus
#
# Here you can create as many Swappers as you like.
# swappers:
#
#   Swapper toggle allows you to specify if it is enabled and if it is usable for players,
#   a good option if you need to temporarily disable it instead of deleting it.
#   - enabled: true
#
#     Content allows you to specify a list of content to replace a placeholder with.
#     You can use PlaceholderAPI placeholders and MiniMessage formatting.
#     content:
#       - "example1"
#       - "%player_name% is <gold><bold>amazing<reset>!"
#       - "%itemsadder_my_super_custom_symbol%"
#
#     Here you can specify the content that will be displayed when the mouse is hovered
#     over the replaced placeholder.
#     You can use PlaceholderAPI placeholders and MiniMessage formatting.
#     content-hover:
#       - "<green>Oh look at that!"
#
#     Swapper's settings allow you to customize how it will behave.
#     settings:
#       Here you can specify what permission a player needs to use this swapper. If the
#       required permission is not given, the player will get a message if it is not set to null.
#       Set 'permission: ""' to disable permission check.
#       permission: "privilege.2"
#
#       The Direct Search option controls how the search works. If you set it to true, it will
#       search exactly for this placeholder and will not care if it is in the middle of a text
#       or not. 
#       
#       EXAMPLE
#         Our text is: "I like bananas".
#         Our placeholder is: "an".
#         The content is: "wow!"
#         In the end, our text will change to this:
#         "I like bwow!wow!as".
#       direct-search: true
#
#       The Random content option controls the behavior of the content list. If you set it to
#       true, it will grab any value from content and insert it instead of a placeholder. If
#       you set it to true, it will grab any value from content and insert it instead of a
#       placeholder. If you set it to false, the first content will be grabbed and inserted
#       instead of the placeholder.
#       If you want to use regex patterns in your placeholder, change this option to true and
#       add $ to the beginning of your regex pattern in the placeholder list.
#       random-content: true
#
#     A list of placeholders that will be replaced with content from the list above.
#     placeholders:
#       - "{example}"
#       - "$(banana|bananas)"
#       - ":lol:"
#
#     Here you can set requirements for using this swapper.
#     requirements:
#       enabled: true
#       use-permission: "swapper.test"
